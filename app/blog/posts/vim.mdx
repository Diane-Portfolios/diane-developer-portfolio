## **Overview**
This tool tells the user exactly which bumper plates need to be added to their barbell to achieve the target weight they're trying to life. The user enters their target weight and the weight of the barbell they're using, they press the "calculate" button, and they are shown how many of each bumper plate to add to the bar.
<br />

## **How It Works**
This was my first project built with Vite, though not my first project using React. This front-end application calculates the difference of the target weight minus the bar weight, then uses Math.floor to distribute the difference among the available weight plates in descending order.

## **Why I Built It / How I Use It**
Explain the real-world problem the project solves, especially how it makes your job (or someone elseâ€™s) easier. Highlight efficiency gains, automation, or improvements over previous methods.

## **Overview**
This tool tells the user exactly which bumper plates need to be added to their barbell to achieve the target weight they're trying to life. The user enters their target weight and the weight of the barbell they're using, they press the "calculate" button, and they are shown how many of each bumper plate to add to the bar.
<br />

## **How It Works**
This was my first project built with Vite, though not my first project using React. This front-end application calculates the difference of the target weight minus the bar weight, then uses Math.floor to distribute the difference among the available weight plates in descending order. 
<br />

## **Why I Built It / How I Use It**
I built this for both myself and my early morning fitness clients. Many were brand new to barbell work and didn't know the most optimal way to load the bar, and many also didn't want to do math at 6 AM. When training multiple clients at once, it became difficult and less-than-efficient to calculate for everyone, so I created a tool that everyone could use on their own to make the most of their session time.

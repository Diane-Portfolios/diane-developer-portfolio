<br />

## **Overview**
Moonbob Money is a full-stack Web3 application that enables users to stake MOONBOB tokens and earn rewards in real-time. The platform combines production-grade smart contracts with a modern React frontend, allowing users to stake tokens without lock periods, monitor real-time reward accumulation, and claim earnings independently while tracking personal balances and pool statistics.
<br />

## **How It Works**
The platform uses a reward-per-token accumulator pattern for gas efficiency, with rewards accumulating every second. Built on Solidity 0.8.28 with OpenZeppelin Contracts for security, the smart contracts include reentrancy protection on all state-changing functions. The frontend leverages Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Wagmi and Viem for Ethereum integration, RainbowKit for seamless wallet connection, and Shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern interface. The development environment uses Hardhat for contract development and testing, with Ethers.js powering 40+ comprehensive test cases achieving 90%+ branch coverage.
<br />

## **Why I Built It / How I Use It**
I built Moonbob Money to gain hands-on experience with Web3 development and understand the full lifecycle of a decentralized application. This project allowed me to dive deep into smart contract security patterns, gas optimization techniques, and the complexities of integrating blockchain functionality with modern frontend frameworks. It demonstrates my ability to build production-ready dApps with comprehensive testing, multi-chain deployment support, and attention to both security and user experience.

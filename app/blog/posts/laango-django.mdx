## **Overview**
I designed this system based on my previous experience working with a language agency. My goal with this project is to automate some of their processes and maximize efficiency, so they can take on a higher volume of clients.
<br />

## **How It Works**
This is my very first project with Python/Django; this service acts as a job board: the agency receives a new job request and enters the details into this database. The job entry will automatically search for interpreters that speak the required language, within a 30-mile radius of the job's zip code. The user is then able to "select all" or select individual interpreters, and send them a text message with all of the job details listed. If the interpreter wants the job, they can respond via text message and get it automatically assigned. Interpreters will also have access to their own profile page, where they can view all of their accepted jobs. Later, I want to add an automated feature that sends out reminders to each interpreter for their upcoming jobs. 
<br />

## **Why I Built It / How I Use It**
I built this to minimize time spent on the phone. The old process required manually pulling up interpreters in a database and calling each one individually to try and get an assignment covered. We often had to leave voicemails and call multiple times to get a response. The goal of this scheduling service is to be able to contact multiple interpreters at once via text, and automatically assign the job to the first one who responds. If this can minimize the amount of time spent on the phone, it could open up the possibility of taking on more volume.

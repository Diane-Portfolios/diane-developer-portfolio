## **Overview**
This tool contains two calculators to assist both coaches and clients in finding their maxes and adjusted sets for their desired APRE protocol. I've also included some helpful tables for intermediate lifters who understand basic weightlifting terminology, but may be new to this particular method of training.
<br />

## **How It Works**
The first calculator identifies the user's 1/3/6/10 rep maxes based on their input data. Depending on which APRE protocol they choose (3/6/10), they will need to input data from their third working set into the second calculator. This will tell the user exactly how to adjust for their fourth working set.

## **Why I Built It / How I Use It**
I built this tool for myself and my fellow coaches at Equinox, for an educational sequence about the APRE method. This is a more advanced training method and is not ideal for beginners, so the tables and vocabulary are tailored to users who already have an intermediate understanding of weightlifting terminology.

## **Overview**
A simple script that shows users their maintenance caloric intake, and recommended macronutrients.
<br />

## **How It Works**
This script is based on a simple formula: it assesses your current bodyweight in pounds and your current activity level to determine your "maintenance" calories, or the caloric intake you need to maintain your current weight. From there, your bodyweight is converted from pounds to kilograms, then multiplied by the recommended numbers per kilogram for each macronutrient: 1.8g for protein, 0.9g for fat, and carbohydrates allotted to the rest of your caloric intake.
<br />

## **Why I Built It / How I Use It**
I built this in 2022, when my training contract at the time prevented me from talking about nutrition with my clients. Many of them had questions about their caloric intake and how to manage their weight sustainably. While I couldn't speak about it with them directly, I could show them this really cool app I built that calculated macronutrients based on whatever user input was provided.
